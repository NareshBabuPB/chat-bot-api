# Flask - Chat API

Flask-Chat API is a simple API for a chat application with basic features. It's mono-repo micro-services application.

> ### Under development

I plan to develop this as micro-services(User-Service and Chat-Service) in a single repository.
For Chat-Service, might use [Flask-SocketIO](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Docker setup and CI/CD to come soon.
